AI Interaction Prompts Used During Development

This document lists representative prompts used during the development of the CoverLetter AI project.  
AI was utilized as a technical assistant to accelerate development, refine architecture, and improve user experience.

Prompts

1.  Create a visually appealing board with three columns: "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." 
    Ensure drag-and-drop functionality for tasks.

2.  How To handle dragging and shuffling in react.js

3.  How to Ensure persistence of 4 color- themes in local storage for my taskgrid project

4. Implement a search bar that filters tasks across all columns instantly as the user types.

5. How to display real-time clock for user to keep track of time

6.  Save all tasks, their statuses, and the selected theme to local storage. Ensure data recovery after browser closure.

7. Add Comments in this project and also Generate a readme file for this project

AI was used as a development accelerator rather than an automated builder.
Each response was reviewed, adapted, and integrated intentionally to ensure the final system reflects structured engineering decisions and modern product-thinking principles.
